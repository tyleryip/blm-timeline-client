This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the BLM Timeline

This project aimed to highlight the progress of the Black Lives Matter movement across Canada, the US, and the global community. A public front-end is used to display news contents stored in the back-end. The content is uploaded to a PostgreSQL database and accessed via a secure login on the front-end. The intention was to update the site daily with new articles and news spotlight to bring attention to the achievements of the various peaceful protests around the world. We opted for manual selection of articles since we wanted to filter out content promoting violence as a means of protesting.
